# PixiJS Battleball

This project aims to demonstrate the use of PixiJS and Colyseus while re-creating Habbo's classic mini-game Battleball.

## The Game

> "To play Battleball, you must have at least two teams, a red team and a blue team, if there are four teams, then green and yellow teams are added. Basically, all you have to do in Battleball is to bounce over squares arranged in a certain way for each stage, on your space hopper. You must bounce on a square three times to "lock" it, it will then become brightly lit up and no-one can go over it again" - [Habbo Fandom](https://habbo.fandom.com/wiki/Battleball)
